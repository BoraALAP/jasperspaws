        <p>If you are interested in adopting a dog listed, please fill out the adoption form. </p>
        <p>
          We will review the adoption form and contact the candidate you if they are a good fit for
          the dog interested in. Please note that due to high volume of application, we will only
          contact those we feel are the right match for the dog, as we simply do not have the
          resources to respond to every inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we review all applications, we will be in contact to complete a home visit. Please
          note that a home visit does not mean that the application has been fully approved, as we
          often conduct multiple home visits for the same dog to find the best match, as our
          ultimate responsibility is to the dogs. If the candidate is not selected for the dog
          applied for, but wish to apply for another dog in the future, a second home visit will not
          be required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once an application is approved, the adoption is finalized by signing an adoption contract
          and transferring the non refundable adoption fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          All adopters will have an opportunity to meet the dog they are interested in prior to
          adoption. Please note that we do NOT arrange transport of the dog in order to facilitate a
          meet and greet. It is the adopterâ€™s responsibility to visit the dog in their foster home.
